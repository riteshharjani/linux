famfs: The kernel component of the famfs shared memory file system
==================================================================

- Copyright (C) 2024 Micron Technology, Inc.

Introduction
============
Compute Express Link (CXL) provides a mechanism for disaggregated or
fabric-attached memory (FAM). This creates opportunities for data sharing;
clustered apps that would otherwise have to shard or replicate data can
share one copy in disaggregated memory.

Famfs, which is not CXL-specific in any way, provides a mechanism for
multiple hosts to use data in shared memory, by giving it a file system
interface. With famfs, any app that understands files (which is all of
them, right?) can access data sets in shared memory. Although famfs
supports read and write calls, the real point is to support mmap, which
provides direct (dax) access to the memory - either writable or read-only.

Shared memory can pose complex coherency and synchronization issues, but
there are also simple cases. Two simple and eminently useful patterns that
occur frequently in data analytics and AI are:

* Serial Sharing - Only one host or process at a time has access to a file
* Read-only Sharing - Multiple hosts or processes share read-only access
  to a file

The famfs kernel file system is part of the famfs framework; User space
components [1] handle metadata allocation and distribution, and direct the
famfs kernel module to instantiate files that map to specific memory.

The famfs framework manages coherency of its own metadata and structures,
but does not attempt to manage coherency for applications.

Famfs also provides data isolation between files. That is, even though
the host has access to an entire memory "device" (as a dax device), apps
cannot write to memory for which the file is read-only, and mapping one
file provides isolation from the memory of all other files. This is pretty
basic, but some experimental shared memory usage patterns provide no such
isolation.

Principles of Operation
=======================

Without its user space components, the famfs kernel module is just a
semi-functional clone of ramfs with latent fs-dax support. The user space
components maintain superblocks and metadata logs, and use the famfs kernel
component to provide a file system view of shared memory across multiple
hosts.

Each host has an independent instance of the famfs kernel module. After
mount, files are not visible until the user space component instantiates
them (normally by playing the famfs metadata log).

Once instantiated, files on each host can point to the same shared memory,
but in-memory metadata (inodes, etc.) is ephemeral on each host that has a
famfs instance mounted. Like ramfs, the famfs in-kernel file system has no
backing store for metadata modifications. If metadata is ever persisted,
that must be done by the user space components. However, mutations to file
data are saved to the shared memory - subject to write permission and
processor cache behavior.


Famfs is Not a Conventional File System
---------------------------------------

Famfs files can be accessed by conventional means, but there are
limitations. The kernel component of famfs is not involved in the
allocation of backing memory for files at all; the famfs user space
creates files and passes the allocation extent lists into the kernel via
the per-file FAMFSIOC_MAP_CREATE ioctl. A file that lacks this metadata is
treated as invalid by the famfs kernel module. As a practical matter files
must be created via the famfs library or cli, but they can be consumed as
if they were conventional files.

Famfs differs in some important ways from conventional file systems:

* Files must be pre-allocated by the famfs framework; Allocation is never
  performed on write.
* Any operation that changes a file's size is considered to put the file
  in an invalid state, disabling access to the data. It may be possible to
  revisit this in the future.
* (Typically the famfs user space can restore files to a valid state by
  replaying the famfs metadata log.)

Famfs exists to apply the existing file system abstractions on top of
shared memory so applications and workflows can more easily consume it.

Key Requirements
================

The primary requirements for famfs are:

1. Must support a file system abstraction backed by sharable dax memory
2. Files must efficiently handle VMA faults
3. Must support metadata distribution in a sharable way
4. Must handle clients with a stale copy of metadata

The famfs kernel component takes care of 1-2 above.

Requirements 3 and 4 are handled by the user space components, and are
largely orthogonal to the functionality of the famfs kernel module.

Requirements 3 and 4 cannot be met by conventional fs-dax file systems
(e.g. xfs and ext4) because they use write-back metadata; it is not valid
to mount such a file system on two hosts from the same in-memory image.


Famfs Usage
===========

Famfs usage is documented at [1].
